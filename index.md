In the words of our Embers:

“I look forward to Emberville Circles. It's like circling around a campfire in the dark of night with friends. Sometimes my own fire is burning so low that it's almost out. But by gathering with other Embers, I feel my fire spread a little more, warming me up. I won't power a boiler system but I can boil a nice cup of tea. I like tea.” 
— Ani

“Choices I made, prices I paid, pain avoided and increased.
Choices made for me, laid out before thee, glory in all the same. 
Abuse done to you, abuse to me, yet here we sit, both of us free.” 
— Tara

“I’ve been here for four days. I was panicking so hard. I would fall on the floor every single day, without moving for the rest of the day, just looking at the wall. And when I started going here, I just started feeling. I didn’t fall any single day since Emberville.”
— Suga

“Emberville is a safe environment to look up the story of who you are and who you want to be and to write it better.”
— Cody

"What we’re doing in Emberville… It’s like an exorcism. We’re pulling the little bits of evil out of us, bit by bit. But then they don’t have to come back in. They’re gone. And we’re happy."
— Anonymous

“We shared experiences on suppressing our thoughts or memories so we wouldn’t have to feel pain or anything at all. It was all very eye opening, because we all have our own pain, our stories are different yet we can come together to sympathize, and let the other know that they’re not alone.”
— Laurel Cadena

“I literally just joined a week ago, and I already feel so much better. I’ve been in therapy for three years, and this just doesn’t compare. I love my therapist. But this is so much better.”
— Jessica Aria Leigh

“I have been writing about my childhood for almost a year. It has been rough. Then I got advice from Emberville: write in third person. That opened my memory and eased everything. My anxiety is gone.”
— Anne Orioni

“Emberville is so amazing. I really appreciate the community and energy it has brought to my life. Thank you for being such a gift. I will recommend Emberville to people in my life. It got me through some really rough months, and I will continue to practice fictional trauma writing.” 
— Najma Kulmie

“Emberville is a really cool thing! It's a wonderful community of people cheering for each other while we write fiction to heal and thrive.” 
— Anonymous

“It is the many varied classes on emotion and trauma that have given my characters and my writing a depth that was missing before.” 
— Damian Peat

“I’m always nervous about participating in online group work because it can feel very detached, but this very much gave off an individual personalized experience since we all were working not independently but as a group.” 
— Chris Boehme

“Emberville has guided me in bringing the darker corners of my personal journey to pages in a way I would never have imagined only a few months ago.... coaxing them toward light, understanding and healing...all while making for a richer character and a stronger narrative.”
— Tyler McKenzie
